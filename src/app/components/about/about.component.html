      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a Software Engineer at <strong>iServeU Pvt Ltd</strong> with a deep
        passion for crafting reliable and delightful digital experiences. Over
        the past few years, I’ve built and optimized scalable applications for
        <strong>Kotak Mahindra Bank</strong>, <strong>NSDL Bank</strong>,
        <strong>Bank of Baroda</strong>, and <strong>FINO Bank</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        My experience spans both <strong>web</strong> and <strong>mobile</strong>
        platforms — from developing secure frontend systems in
        <strong>Angular</strong> and <strong>RxJS</strong> to building
        intuitive Android apps with <strong>Jetpack Compose</strong>. I’m driven
        by clean architecture, performance excellence, and a strong sense of
        user empathy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of work, I’m constantly exploring new design patterns,
        accessibility practices, and the latest frontend tools to keep my
        development process efficient and user-centered.

      <h3>Current Focus</h3>
      <p>
        I’m currently focused on engineering secure, real-time banking solutions
        for <strong>Kotak Mahindra Bank</strong> and <strong>NSDL Bank</strong>.
        My primary goal is to optimize performance and reliability in
        <strong>Angular</strong> applications through efficient state management,
        <strong>RxJS</strong> streams, and advanced <strong>UI performance
        tuning</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m also exploring scalable frontend infrastructure practices —
        improving code modularity, strengthening <strong>security policies</strong>,
        and integrating automation to enhance development workflows and
        deployment speed.
